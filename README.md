# All the dotfile that I need to be happy 

this is a collection of self-write dotfile and some *heavy* inspired config from [unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn). all needed stuff can be find on [my github](https://github.com/alecromski) or on the [OppaiWeeb](https://github.com/OppaiWeeb) github

at this time, just copy past all things you want/need.
I'm on my way to write a scrip to automtisate the installation.
